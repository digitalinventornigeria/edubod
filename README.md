#Downlink Transmission Techniques
  OFDM/OFDMA, Time and frequency grid, L1/L2
  OFDM: Transmission, 20Mhz (1200 subcarriers). Tx/Rx
  OFDMA:
  Downlink: OFDM, 15Hz
  dl physical resource:1 slot=0.5ms. 7 OFDM symbols, 1 RB (12*7 =84 RE)
    Scheduling block (SB) = 2 resource blocks, 1 ms
   ofdm properties (ifft -> cp insertion
   delay spread << symbol time < coherence time
  physical signals vs channels 
  reference signals
    cell-specific reerenve signals
    mbsfn referencve signals
    ue-specific reference signals
  control signaling (downlink scheduling assignment, uplink scheduling grants, harq acknoowledgement) (spectral efficiency)
    reference symbols
    l1/l2 control
  Downlink Physical channels for L1/L@ control panels
      Logical CHannels(type of info :traffic control): pcch, mtcfh, mcch, bcch,dtch, dcch, cch)
      Transport CHnanels (how and with what characteristics(coomon/shared/mobile) pch,mch,bch, dl-sch
      Physical CHannels (bits,symbols, modulation, radio frames etc) pmch, pb ch, pdsch , pcfich,pdcch, phich
      Physical Signals (only L1 info) rs  p-ss s-ss
